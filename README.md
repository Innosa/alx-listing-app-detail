## Project Description
This Listing App project aims to scaffold and lay the foundational structure for a modern Airbnb clone. This initial task focuses on setting up a well-organized and scalable codebase using Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and ESLint. By establishing these clean folder structures, reusable components, and adhering to best practices, the project ensures a solid starting point for building a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly property listing page, where users can view property listings with details such as images, prices, booking, and descriptions.

## Technical Requirement
1. Next.js version 13+ installed.
2. Node.js version 16+ installed locally.
3. Text editor (e.g., VS Code) with TypeScript and TailwindCSS extensions installed.

## Project Structure
- **/Project Setup**- Scaffold a Next.js application named alx-listing-app with TypeScript, ESLint, and TailwindCSS enabled.Then configure TailwindCSS using a minimal and clean configuration (tailwind.config.js and globals.css).
- **components/** – Establish a clean folder structure, including directories for components/, interfaces/, constants/, and public/assets/.
Create reusable components such as Card,  Button and layout elements for modularity and scalability. 
- **integration of typscript/** – Define TypeScript interfaces (CardProps, ButtonProps, etc.) to be used in interfaces/index.ts throughout the project to ensure type safety and code consistency.  
- **constants/** – Stores constant values such as configuration data and static variables.  
- **public/assets/** – 
Organize assets, to include/hold images, SVGs and other static files to be used in the app, under public/assets/ for easy access and maintenance.

## How to Run the Project Locally
1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project root directory.  
2. Install all project dependencies:
   npm install.
3. Once all the files are created, run the project locally using the following command:

Open the project in your browser at http://localhost:3000 to ensure the Next.js app is running without errors.
